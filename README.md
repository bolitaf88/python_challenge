**Assignments Demonstrating My Work at the GW Bootcamp**

**PyBank Challenge**  
In this challenge, we were tasked with developing code to calculate totals for months of profit/losses, total profits, average changes, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits. Please refer to the file named *"financial_analysis2.txt,"* as it provides more accurate data aligned with the assignment's expectations. While my calculated average change is close to the expected figure of approximately -8,300, I did not obtain a negative value for this metric.  

I would also like to highlight an issue I encountered during this assignment: upon initially downloading the PyBank file onto my computer, I noticed one row of data was missing. This discrepancy resulted in inaccurate calculations of total months. I had to re-download the Excel file to successfully complete the assignment and produce accurate figures.

**PyPoll Challenge**  
Based on my analysis, Diana DeGette is projected to win the state elections, securing approximately 73.812% of the votes, which represents a decisive landslide victory. Her closest competitor, Charles Stockham, garnered 23.049% of the votes, while Raymon Doane received only 3.139%.  

While slight flaws in the electoral process cannot be entirely ruled out, these results are highly accurate. All necessary measures were taken to minimize any potential electoral malpractice and ensure the integrity of the analysis.
