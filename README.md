Assignments demonstrating my work at the GW bootcamp 

PyBank Challenge: In this challenge, We were expected to come up with code 
 gives totals for months of profit/losses made, total profits, average 
changes, grtest inc in profits and grtest decreases. Please use the 

file that says "financial_analysis2.txt"  because it gives more accurate
data to the expectations of the assignment. The Avg change is somewhat 
close to the -8300 figure, with the exception that, I didn't get a negative 
figure for the Avg Change. More, I also want to bring to the grader's notice 
that opon downloading the pybank file into my computer, I lost one row, that gave me completely different when generating the total months, and 
I had to redownload the excel file before successfully completing the 
assignment to give me accurate figures.

PyPoll challenge: based on our analysis, Diana Degette is projected to win 
the state elections garnering about 73.812% of the votes, giving 
her a land slide victory. Her closest competitor Mr. Charles Stockham 
got 23.049% of the votes, while Raymon Doane got just 3.139% of votes. while 
we don't rule out some slight flaws in the electoral process, these results 
are very accurate as all measures were taken to prevent all forms of 
electoral malpractices.
